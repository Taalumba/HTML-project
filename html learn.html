	<h1>HTML Learning Space</h1>

	This is my first web page. Being desirous to learn how to code in JavaScript, I began to learn from a web page. But I soon discovered that in order to build a full website, I needed to first gain knowledge in HTML coding so that I could build a page, and then a site. I am excited about this challenge and look forward to learning more and more each day.
<p>And now we move on to the segment about paragraphing in HTML</p>
<p>Yes this <em>is</em> very exciting for me indeed.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Level of excitement may cause head to explode.</p>
	<br> This portion of text has been seperated by the line break tag, earlier used in the above first paragraph. However, I have now been informed that this is poor practice and I should not over use the line break (< br >) tag. Us paragraph tag for paragraphing.
<h1>Here we deal with headings</h1>
<h2>What this is</h2>
	<p>A simple page put together using HTML. Written on a notepad, and viewed on Mozilla Firefox browser</p>
<h2>Why this is</h2>
	<p>To learn HTML. I believe learning a new skill set is beneficial to me, and allows me to have broader depth of knowledge. It has been notes, that where a heading tag is used, there is no need for a paragraph tag to be present as well. Also note that the < h1 > tag is only used once as the main heading for the section, while the < h2 > to < h6 > tags can used as often as desired. But always use them in order i.e. < h3 > before < h4 > etc.</p>

<h1>Lists</h1>
<p>In this part we will be dealing with lists. Unordered, ordered and definition lists. So why am I building this site again?</p>
<ul>
	<li>To learn HTML</li>
	<li>To show off</li>
	<li>To become one with the net and create a sentient being with it</li>
</ul>
<p>What would be the purpose of achieving the three above stated goals?</p>
<ol>
	<li>To become even more computer literate</li>
	<li>To become highly employable</li>
	<li>To build my own site for my own purposes</li>
	<li>To meet Motoko Kusanagi and The Puppet Master on the other side</li>
	<li>World domination.</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, lists can be put inside lists. I shall now elaborate on the first list and demonstrate</p>
<ul>
	<li>To learn HTML</li>
	<li>To show off
<ol>
	<li>To my boss</li>
	<li>To my friends</li>
	<li>To all geeks in my immediate vicinity</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>To become one with the net and create a sentient being with it</li>
</ul>
<h1>Links</h1>
<p>We now move on to this most pertinent topic. So far I have been making a stand-alone web page, now lets use the Hypertext parts of "HTML"</p>
<h2>Where to find the tutorial I used:</h2>
<p>It can be found at the link below. Enjoy! :-)</p>
	<p><a
	href="http://www.htmldog.com">HTML Dog</a></p>
<p>We can also link to other documents and files that are in the same directory. For example:</p>
	<p><a
	href="Dream bed.jpg">My Dream Bed</a>. This is where I shall lay my head some day.</p>
<p>Links can also be used to send you to specific places on the same page; for example:</p>
	<p><a
	href="#top">Go to top</a>
<h1>Images</h1>
<p>In this part we'll learn about adding images to HTML documents. I know, at this moment in time you may be thinking</p>
<img
src="pics\where.png"
width="300"
height="330"
alt="Where the heck am I.......?">
<p>Where the heck am I.......?</p>
<p>But at this point all I have to say to you is</p>
<img
src="pics\keep-calm-and-trust-jesus.jpg"
width="300"
height="300"
alt="Keep calm and trust Jesus">
<p>LOL! Yes! and as the more widely read of you may well know, this particular meme is a reinterpretation of the a poster that was produced  during one of the World Wars, and put up all across London and the United Kingdom, during the severe German bombing raids. The aim was to try and keep people from panicking and assure them that 'this too shall pass' and everything will be OK, and life would go on. So no need to panic.</p>
<img
src="pics\keep-calm.jpg"
width="300"
height="348"
alt="Keep calm and carry on">
<p>And so, good reader, Keep calm and carry on. Or as old Winston would put it, Keep buggering on!</p>
<h1>Tables</h1>
<p>As the title ever so succinctly puts it, in this part we shall construct some tables and use them for their correct purpose; structuring tabular data, not formating a page as many tend to do.</p>

<table>
<tr>
	<td>Row 1,
cell 1</td>
	<td>Row 1,
cell 2</td>
	<td>Row 1,
cell 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Row 2,
cell 1</td>
	<td>Row 2,
cell 2</td>
	<td>Row 2,
cell 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Row 3,
cell 1</td>
	<td>Row 3,
cell 2</td>
	<td>Row 3,
cell 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Row 4,
cell 1</td>
	<td>Row 4,
cell 2</td>
	<td>Row 4,
cell 3</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h1>Forms</h1>
<p>OK.... So as we can see, I did something wrong in the tables section even though I followed the exact code given on the site... Hmm, will have to get back to that and fix it a little bit later on. Next is forms. These are used to collect data from the user, as an interface or to send data across the web. On their own their not too useful, but when used in conjunction with other languages to process data, great. Now we build a sample form.</p>
<form
action="processingscript.php"
method="post">
</form>
<textarea
rows="5"
cols="20">Your text here
</textarea>
<select>
	<option>Knight</option>
	<option>Archer</option>
	<option>Mage</option>
	<option>White Mage</option>
	<option
value="fifth option">Mime</option>
</select>
<input
name="class">
<form
action="contactus.php"
method="post">

<p>Now, lets say we wanted all the animals entering Noahs arc to fill out an online form before they got into the arc - for purely administrative purposes ofcourse (wink wink). The form might look something like this:</p>

<p>Name:</p>
<p><input
name="name"
value="Your name"></p>

<p>Species:</p>
<p><input
name="species"></p>

<p>Comments:</p>
<p><textarea
name="comments"
rows="5"
cols="20">Your comment</textarea></p>

<p>Are you:</p>
<p><input
type="radio"
name="areyou"
value="male">
Male</p>
<p><input
type="radio"
name="areyou"
value="female">
Female</p>
<p><input
type="radio"
name="areyou"
value="hermaphrodite">
An hermaphrodite</p>
<p><input
type="radio"
name="areyou"
value="asexual">
Asexual</p>

<p><input
type="submit"></p>
</form>

<h2>Congratulations!</h2>
<p>And thats it! I have successfully learned how to build a website using HTML! Congratuations me, I can now officially call myself a coder! Yay! According to HTML Dog, I am actually better than most. Now We move on to CSS for beginners. Apparently this is where we learn how to make it all look pretty. :-)</p>

<p>I think you're truly something special
<br>Just what my dreams are really made of
<br>Lets stay together me and you girl
<br>There's no one like you around
<br>I really like....</p>
<p>Sorry, was just messing around with the line break function there lol!</p>

<h1>CSS Beginner Tutorial</h1>
<p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets", and they are used to change the presetation (appearance) of HTML documents. They're completely different from HTML. They take the form of "property: value", and these can be applied to most HTML tags.</p>
<h2>Applying CSS</h2>
<p>This can be done in one of three ways: Inline, internal, and external</p>

<h3>Inline</h3>
<p
style="color:red">That's how I made this sentence red.</p>
<p>But HTML Dog does not recommend this style as they believe HTML should be a stand-alone doc.</p>

<h3>Internal</h3>
<p>These are used for the whole page, so they go into the head element. According to the tutorial I was supposed to transform THIS page, but I like how this one looks... So I won't be changing this page. But I'll be add a link to a seperate page that is modified using the internal method. Check out its elements for the method.</p>
<p><a
href="html css internal.html">Internally embedded examlpe page</a></p>
<p>SUCCESS!!! All elements and links work!!! This is seriously mad exciting!</p>
<p>And here's another example page for good measure</p>
<p><a
href="html css internal 2.html">Internally embedded example page 2</a></p>
<p>OK.... Composure... Moving on.</p>

<h3>External</h3>
<p>These are the prefered style for HTML Dog, as they are completely seperate from the HTML document. They are used for the whole multipage website, and use a separate CSS file.</p>
<p>First we need to edit the head of the main HTML file (this one), so that it refers to the external CSS file for style. So i will add the "stylesheet" link to the head up top.</p>

<h2>Selectors, properties and values</h2>
<p>Selectors are to CSS, what tags are to HTML. And each selector has properties found inside {..:..} these. And properties have values after the colon, while semi-colons seperate values.</p> 

<h2>Colors</h2>
<p>CSS brings 16 million plus colours to ya... And these can be specified by name, RGB value or hex code. Eg, all the following will give the same red but are expressed differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>red</li>
<li>rgd(255,0,0)</li>
<li>rgb(100%,0%,0%)</li>
<li>#ff0000</li>
<li>#f00</li>
</ul>

<p>Some colours have predefined names, but these are just the major solid ones and are limiting. getting all the colours requires use of rgb values or the hexadecimal values. CSS3 and up also allow you to control hue, saturation and lightness (HSL).</p>

<h3>Colour and background colour</h3>
<p>Colours can be added to both text and background; unfortunately, we must spell it "color" like Americans, and not "colour" like normal people. *sigh*. We shall now make all major headings yellow with a blue background using the CSS file, and then modify.</p>

<h3>Text</h3>
<p>Text size and shape can also be changed. You change the font family; like with headings 2 here. Another thing you can do is modify font size; duh. Warning, dont make headings using the < p > tag. use the < h1,2,3 > tags. Its not recommended to just use p.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we can change font-weight, which tells us if font is bold or nah; there are actually several values of these. Values between bolder and lighter.</p>

<h4>Bold</h4>
<p>And the heading "Bold", here has been modifed for weight and style. we can also use the "{font-variant: small caps}" and the "{text-transform: upper case}" properties and values. Externally embedded of course. There is also {text-decoration} which determines if text has a line running through, over or under it, with the "underline", "overline", and "line-through" values. You can also specify "none" with this one. But really, underlines should only be used for links.</p>
<p>As already stated, there is a text-transform property, which changes the case of text and has capitalize, uppercase, lowercase and none values.</p> 

<h4>Text spacing</h4>
